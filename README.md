# Horiseon-Website-Support

This webpage was built for a Social Media Marketing company called Horiseon. I was asked to make the website more accessible to people accessing the webpage through assistive technologies. 
In order to do this I created alternative text for all images and adapted the HTML structuring so that the webpage code was more structured for accessible technologies to access.
